# Chissor

Chissor is a simple GUI application for Chinese word segmentation
powered by the excellent
[Rust Jieba implementation](https://github.com/messense/jieba-rs).
The name *Chissor* is pronounced as *scissor*, but with a *sh* instead
of *s* (BrE [ˈʃɪzə]), to allude to ‘Chinese’ and ‘to cut’.

## How to Build
In order to build it, you need a working
[Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).  Then, it’s
a matter of running `cargo build --release`.
